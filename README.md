# Data Structures Project
A set of data structures created in Java.

## Author
Renato Scudere.

## About
This is a set of custom data structures I created after completing
a data structures course to reinforce my understanding of common
data structures.

## The Source Code
The src directory contains two subdirectories, myCollections and
searchTrees. myCollections contains data structures similar to the
data structures found in the Java Collections framework. searchTrees
contains binary search tree data structures.

### myCollections
- Dynamic array list data structure.
- Linked list data structure.
- Stack data structure.
- Queue data structure.
- Min/Max heap data structures.
- Hash map and hash set data structures.

### searchTrees
- AVL binary search tree implementation.
- Binary search tree node.
- Tree map data structure.
- Tree set data structure.
